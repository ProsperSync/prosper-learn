## Executor Run #17 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-027**: Fix .env.example Variable Name Discrepancy

### Files Changed
- `.env.example` — Replaced incorrect variable names (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) with correct `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefixed versions matching source code. Added `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`. Added explanatory comments.
- `TASKS.md` — Moved TASK-027 to Completed Tasks section.
- `PROGRESS.md` — Added this run entry.

### Key Decisions
- Added `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` to `.env.example` since `src/lib/sentry/sentryService.ts` reads `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` — this was not in the original `.env.example` at all.
- Confirmed `.gitignore` already includes `.env` — no change needed.
- All pre-existing TypeScript errors are in `infrastructure/supabase/functions/` (Deno modules) and existing source code — no new errors introduced by this change.

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — same pre-existing errors as before, zero new errors from this change.
- `.env.example` variable names verified against `src/config/supabase.ts` (`EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) and `src/lib/sentry/sentryService.ts` (`EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`).

## Planner Run #18 — 2026-03-21

### Planning Focus
Identified critical silent-failure risks in the production build pipeline: EAS cloud builds do not include local `.env` files, and the `.env.example` documents wrong variable names vs. what the code actually reads.

### Key Discoveries
- **CRITICAL: `.env.example` uses wrong variable names** — File documents `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, but `src/config/supabase.ts` reads `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. `src/lib/ai/` similarly uses `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`. Any build following `.env.example` will silently initialize Supabase with empty strings.
- **CRITICAL: EAS Secrets never tracked** — `eas build` runs on Expo's cloud servers. Local `.env` files are not uploaded. All three production secrets must be explicitly set via `eas secret:create` before the production build. This was an untracked P0 gap.
- **No smoke test task existed** — TASK-003 acceptance criteria require a signed AAB submission, but there was no task to verify the production build actually functions before uploading to Play Console.
- **Stage confirmed**: Pre-release. All engineering and legal tasks are complete. All remaining P0 blockers are external-account / human-action tasks.
- **Post-launch task queue remains full and valid** — TASK-010, TASK-015, TASK-017, TASK-018, TASK-019 correctly deferred post-TASK-003.

### Key Decisions
- **Added TASK-025** (P0): EAS Build Secrets — configure `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` as EAS project secrets via `eas secret:create`. Hard dependency of TASK-026 and a hidden blocker for TASK-003.
- **Added TASK-026** (P0): Production APK Smoke Test — install preview APK on Android device/emulator and verify 7 key flows (cold launch, sign-up, onboarding, lesson completion, AI Tutor, profile, legal links) before submitting to Play Store.
- **Added TASK-027** (P1): Fix `.env.example` — rename variables to `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix to match actual code and add explanatory comment. 5-minute fix, prevents silent misconfiguration.
- **Revised launch critical path**: TASK-022 + TASK-023 + TASK-020 (parallel) → TASK-025 → TASK-026 → TASK-024 → TASK-003

### Tasks Added
- TASK-025 (P0): Configure EAS Build Secrets
- TASK-026 (P0): Production APK Smoke Test
- TASK-027 (P1): Fix .env.example Variable Names

### Updated Critical Path to Launch
1. TASK-022 — EAS account + `eas init` (parallel with TASK-023, TASK-020)
2. TASK-023 — Google Play Developer account + service account key (parallel)
3. TASK-020 — Enable GitHub Pages + verify privacy policy URL resolves (parallel)
4. TASK-025 — Set EAS Secrets (EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY) — depends on TASK-022
5. TASK-027 — Fix .env.example (can run any time)
6. TASK-026 — Preview APK smoke test (depends on TASK-025)
7. TASK-024 — Capture 4 Play Store screenshots (depends on TASK-022, overlaps with TASK-026)
8. TASK-003 — Production EAS build + Play Console submission (the launch)

---

## Planner Run #17 — 2026-03-21

### Planning Focus
Identifying untracked execution prerequisites for TASK-003 (Play Store submission) that would silently block launch.

### Key Decisions
- **EAS Account gap identified**: `eas build` requires `eas init` to embed a `projectId` in `app.json`. This was mentioned in TASK-003's description as context ("requires EAS account") but never tracked as its own actionable task. Added TASK-022 (P0).
- **Play Console account gap identified**: `eas.json` references `./google-service-account.json` which does not exist in the repo. A Google Play Developer account ($25) and GCP service account linked to Play Console are required. Added TASK-023 (P0).
- **Screenshot process gap identified**: TASK-003 acceptance criteria requires "4 screenshots" but the how was completely unspecified. Fastest path for Expo managed workflow is a preview APK → Android emulator. Added TASK-024 (P1).
- **Post-launch task queue is complete** — no new P2/P3 tasks needed; TASK-010, TASK-015, TASK-017, TASK-018, TASK-019 cover all post-launch domains.

### Tasks Added
- TASK-022 (P0): EAS Account Setup & Project Linking
- TASK-023 (P0): Google Play Developer Account & Service Account Key Setup
- TASK-024 (P1): Capture Play Store Screenshots via Preview Build

### Revised Launch Critical Path
TASK-022 + TASK-023 + TASK-020 (parallel) → TASK-024 → TASK-003

---

## Executor Run #16 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-021**: Write Optimized Play Store Full Listing Description

### Files Changed
- `docs/store-listing.md` — **CREATED** — Complete Play Store listing with short description, full description, keyword tags, keyword audit table, and content rating notes
- `TASKS.md` — Moved TASK-021 to Completed Tasks section, updated run counter to #16
- `PROGRESS.md` — Added this executor run entry

### Key Decisions
- Short description (71 chars): "Master personal finance with bite-sized lessons, quizzes & XP rewards" — front-loads the value proposition within the 80-char limit
- Full description (~1,920 chars): structured with a hook → features → topics → audience → trust → CTA format. Keeps well within the 4,000-char max while being substantive enough (above 1,500-char minimum)
- Hook paragraph designed so the first 167 characters (Play Store "Read more" cutoff) form a standalone compelling pitch
- All 8 target keywords from the task spec included naturally: financial education, personal finance, budgeting app, investing basics, money management, financial literacy, learn finance, finance for beginners
- 5 keyword tags chosen for Play Console: financial education, personal finance app, budgeting app, financial literacy, learn finance
- Added content rating questionnaire guidance notes (Education category, no violence/adult content) to help whoever fills out Play Console

### Verification Results
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero new TypeScript errors (this task only added a markdown file)
- Short description character count: 71 (within ≤80 limit) ✅
- Full description character count: ~1,920 (within 1,500–4,000 range) ✅
- All 8 target keywords present ✅
- First 167 chars form standalone hook ✅
- Trust paragraph included (no ads, no in-app purchases, not financial advice) ✅
- 5 keyword tags listed ✅

## Planner Run #15 — 2026-03-21

### Stage Assessment
**LAUNCH READY** — All engineering, legal, and infrastructure tasks are complete. TASK-016 (GitHub Pages) was completed by Executor Run #15: `docs/` folder exists with landing page + privacy policy + terms pages, and `app.json` has `expo.extra.privacyPolicyUrl` set. TASK-003 (Play Store Submission) is the only P0 task remaining, now fully unblocked.

### Key Discoveries
- **TASK-016 ✅ CONFIRMED COMPLETE**: `docs/index.html`, `docs/privacy-policy.html`, `docs/terms.html` all exist. `app.json` `expo.extra.privacyPolicyUrl` = `"https://prospersync.github.io/prosper-learn/privacy-policy.html"`. Executor Run #15 succeeded.
- **GitHub Pages activation is an untracked pre-flight gap**: The docs/ files are committed, but GitHub Pages must be manually enabled in repo Settings → Pages → Source: /docs, branch: main. No prior task tracked this step. Added TASK-020 (P0) to close this risk before TASK-003 runs.
- **Play Store listing copy doesn't exist yet**: TASK-003 bundles "write listing description" into the submission task, but this is non-trivial ASO work best separated. Added TASK-021 (P1) to produce `docs/store-listing.md` in parallel with EAS build setup.
- **TASK-003 description updated**: Removed stale "only remaining dep is TASK-016" language. Added specific EAS build commands, Play Console navigation steps, screenshot specs (min 320px, JPEG/24-bit PNG, max 8MB), content rating guidance (Education category), and clarification that submit targets Internal Testing track per eas.json.
- **No analytics, Sentry, or push notifications in package.json** — TASK-010, TASK-015, TASK-017, TASK-018, TASK-019 all remain correctly deferred to post-launch.
- **eas.json submit track is "internal"** — First Play Store submission will go to Internal Testing, not Production rollout. This is intentional. After verification, the developer manually promotes to Production in Play Console.

### Key Decisions
- Added **TASK-020** (P0): GitHub Pages pre-flight check — prevents silent launch failure
- Added **TASK-021** (P1): Play Store listing copy — separates ASO writing from technical build work, enables parallelization
- **TASK-003 description rewritten** to provide complete executor-ready instructions with no ambiguity

### Current Active Task Priority Order
1. TASK-020 (P0) — Enable GitHub Pages + verify privacy policy URL resolves (~5 min manual step)
2. TASK-021 (P1) — Write listing copy → `docs/store-listing.md` (can run in parallel with build)
3. TASK-003 (P0) — eas build production → Play Console submission (the launch itself)
4. TASK-015 (P2) — Push notifications (post-launch, Day-2 retention)
5. TASK-010 (P2) — Sentry crash reporting (post-launch observability)
6. TASK-018 (P2) — Behavioral analytics (post-launch product decisions)
7. TASK-017 (P2) — In-app rating prompt (post-launch Play Store rating growth)
8. TASK-019 (P3) — Achievement social sharing (post-launch viral growth)

### Privacy Policy URL Reference
**Canonical URL**: `https://prospersync.github.io/prosper-learn/privacy-policy.html`
**Landing Page**: `https://prospersync.github.io/prosper-learn/`
**Terms Page**: `https://prospersync.github.io/prosper-learn/terms.html`
Set in `app.json` as `expo.extra.privacyPolicyUrl`. Must match exactly what is entered in Play Console.

---

## Executor Run #15 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-016**: Create App Landing Page on GitHub Pages (Privacy Policy Host)

### Files Changed
- **CREATED** `docs/index.html` — Landing page with hero, 6 feature cards, about section, legal links, footer
- **CREATED** `docs/privacy-policy.html` — Full privacy policy (copied from PrivacyPolicyScreen.tsx)
- **CREATED** `docs/terms.html` — Full terms of service (copied from TermsOfServiceScreen.tsx)
- **MODIFIED** `app.json` — Added `expo.extra.privacyPolicyUrl: "https://prospersync.github.io/prosper-learn/privacy-policy.html"`
- **MODIFIED** `TASKS.md` — Moved TASK-016 to Completed, updated TASK-003 dependencies
- **MODIFIED** `PROGRESS.md` — This entry

### Key Decisions
- Created three separate HTML files (index, privacy-policy, terms) rather than a single long page for better readability and direct linking from Play Console
- Used pure static HTML/CSS with system font stack — no JavaScript, no build step, no dependencies
- Privacy policy URL for Play Console: `https://prospersync.github.io/prosper-learn/privacy-policy.html`
- Landing page URL: `https://prospersync.github.io/prosper-learn/`
- All pages are mobile-responsive with meta viewport tag
- Consistent brand green (#4CAF50) across all pages

### Verification Results
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — All errors are pre-existing (Deno edge functions, existing module issues). Zero new errors introduced.
- `app.json` validated — valid JSON with new `extra.privacyPolicyUrl` field
- All three HTML files are valid, self-contained, and cross-linked

### Remaining Action (Manual)
- **Enable GitHub Pages** in repo Settings → Pages → Source: `/docs`, Branch: `main`. This must be done manually in the GitHub web UI.

### Impact on Critical Path
- **TASK-016 ✅ COMPLETE** — sole blocker for TASK-003 is now resolved
- **TASK-003 is now FULLY UNBLOCKED** — all dependencies satisfied (TASK-007 ✅, TASK-011 ✅, TASK-012 ✅, TASK-013 ✅, TASK-014 ✅, TASK-016 ✅)

---
## Planner Run #14 — 2026-03-21

### Stage Assessment
**PRE-RELEASE** — The app is fully engineered and legally complete. Two tasks remain on the critical path to launch: TASK-016 (GitHub Pages, provides hosted privacy policy URL for Play Console) and TASK-003 (Play Store submission). Once TASK-016 is completed, an executor can submit the app.

### Key Discoveries
- **TASK-014 ✅ CONFIRMED COMPLETE**: `src/screens/TermsOfServiceScreen.tsx` AND `app/terms-of-service.tsx` both exist. Executor Run #14 genuinely completed this task. Updated TASK-003 dependencies accordingly.
- **docs/ folder ABSENT**: No `docs/` directory at repo root — TASK-016 is definitively not done and remains the sole launch blocker.
- **app.json `extra` is empty `{}`**: The `privacyPolicyUrl` field that TASK-016 must set has not been added. Confirms TASK-016 is active blocker.
- **app.json plugins: only `expo-router`**: No expo-notifications, sentry-expo, or Firebase. TASK-015 and TASK-010 are not started.
- **Zero behavioral analytics**: The app will launch with no user behavior data. Added TASK-018 to address this post-launch.
- **No social sharing**: Gamification produces shareable moments (badges, track completions) but no share mechanism exists. Added TASK-019 as P3 post-launch growth lever.

### Key Decisions
- **Added TASK-018** (Behavioral Analytics, P2): Firebase Analytics or Amplitude, 6 key events. Deferred until after TASK-003 (Firebase project needs production package ID).
- **Added TASK-019** (Achievement Social Sharing, P3): expo-sharing + shareAchievement() function. Deferred post-launch.
- **TASK-003 dependencies updated**: Added TASK-014 to confirmed deps list.

### Current Active Task Priority Order
1. TASK-016 (P1) — GitHub Pages landing page (sole blocker for TASK-003)
2. TASK-003 (P0) — Play Store submission (depends on TASK-016)
3. TASK-015 (P2) — Push notifications (post-launch, Day-2 retention)
4. TASK-010 (P2) — Sentry crash reporting (post-launch observability)
5. TASK-018 (P2) — Behavioral analytics (post-launch product decisions)
6. TASK-017 (P2) — In-app rating prompt (post-launch Play Store rating growth)
7. TASK-019 (P3) — Achievement social sharing (post-launch viral growth)

### Updated Critical Path to Launch
1. TASK-016 → Create docs/index.html + enable GitHub Pages → provides stable privacy policy URL
2. TASK-003 → eas build production → Play Console listing + screenshots → submit

### Post-Launch Sprint Plan (first 4 weeks)
- Week 1: TASK-015 (push notifications) + TASK-010 (Sentry) — protect and retain early users
- Week 2: TASK-018 (behavioral analytics) — start data collection for first product review
- Week 4+: TASK-017 (in-app rating prompt) + TASK-019 (social sharing) — growth flywheel

## Executor Run #14 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-014**: Add Terms of Service Screen

### Files Changed
- **Created** `src/screens/TermsOfServiceScreen.tsx` — complete scrollable ToS document (10 sections)
- **Created** `app/terms-of-service.tsx` — expo-router route file
- **Modified** `app/_layout.tsx` — registered `terms-of-service` route, allowed unauthenticated access
- **Modified** `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` — added "Terms of Service" link in Legal section
- **Modified** `app/auth/index.tsx` — added legal agreement text with links on sign-up form
- **Modified** `src/i18n/en.json` — added `profile.termsOfService`, `auth.agreePrefix`, `auth.agreeAnd`
- **Modified** `src/i18n/pt-BR.json` — added Portuguese translations for the same keys
- **Modified** `TASKS.md` — moved TASK-014 to Completed Tasks

### Key Decisions
- Modeled ToS screen after the existing `PrivacyPolicyScreen` for visual consistency (same header, styling, layout)
- Made the "not financial advice" disclaimer prominent with a red-highlighted notice box (`importantNote` style)
- Governing law set to Brazil (Federative Republic of Brazil) based on the developer's location
- Sign-up agreement text only appears in `signUp` mode, not `signIn` — reduces clutter for returning users
- Age requirement set to 13+ (matching Children's Privacy section in the Privacy Policy)
- Used `useRouter` from expo-router for navigation from auth screen to legal pages

### Verification Results
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: All errors are pre-existing (Deno infrastructure files, education component index exports, AI tutor type). Zero new errors introduced.
- All acceptance criteria met: ToS screen exists, covers all required topics, route registered, Profile link added, auth agreement text added, unauthenticated access allowed, i18n complete.

### Impact on Other Tasks
- **TASK-016** (GitHub Pages Landing Page) is now unblocked — its dependency on TASK-014 is satisfied. TASK-016 depends on TASK-012 ✅ and TASK-014 ✅, both now complete.

---

## Planner Run #13 — 2026-03-21

### Stage Assessment
**PRE-RELEASE — LAUNCH IMMINENT.** All engineering tasks complete. Two tasks remain before the app reaches real users: TASK-016 (GitHub Pages, must run first to supply the privacy policy URL) → TASK-003 (Play Store submission).

### Key Discoveries
- **TASK-003 is now effectively unblocked** from an engineering standpoint. TASK-007 ✅, TASK-011 ✅, TASK-012 ✅, TASK-013 ✅ are all done.
- **Critical gap found**: Play Console requires a publicly hosted URL for the privacy policy. The in-app `PrivacyPolicyScreen` is not a valid URL. TASK-016 (GitHub Pages) must happen first.
- **TASK-016 was wrongly P3** — it was planned as a marketing/growth item but is actually a legal/launch prerequisite. Escalated to P1 and added as a formal dependency of TASK-003.
- **TASK-003 escalated to P0** — it is the literal launch gate. Every completed task leads here.
- **No `expo-notifications` or `@sentry/react-native`** in package.json — TASK-015 and TASK-010 are genuinely not started.
- **No `TermsOfServiceScreen.tsx`** in `src/screens/` — TASK-014 is genuinely not started.
- **New task TASK-017 added**: In-App Rating Prompt (P2, post-launch). Fires after user's 5th lesson completion using `expo-store-review`. Drives Play Store rating organically.

### Key Decisions
- Escalated TASK-016 from P3 → P1 and made it a formal dependency of TASK-003
- Escalated TASK-003 from P1 → P0 (it IS the launch)
- Added TASK-017 (In-App Rating Request, P2) as the highest-value post-launch growth task not yet in the backlog
- Post-launch priority queue: TASK-014 (ToS) → TASK-015 (Push Notifications) → TASK-010 (Sentry) → TASK-017 (Rating Prompt)

### Canonical Privacy Policy URL
**PENDING** — Will be established by TASK-016 (GitHub Pages). Expected format: `https://danielelielgaio.github.io/prosper-learn/` or similar. Must be entered into Play Console and `app.json` (`expo.extra.privacyPolicyUrl`) once available.

## Executor Run #13 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-007**: Create Custom Branded App Icon & Splash Screen

### Changes Made
1. **Replaced `assets/icon.png`** (1024×1024 RGB PNG): Brand green (#4CAF50) background with white logomark (open book + upward growth arrow)
2. **Replaced `assets/adaptive-icon.png`** (1024×1024 RGBA PNG, transparent BG): Same white logomark for Android adaptive icon system
3. **Replaced `assets/splash.png`** (1242×2436 RGB PNG): Brand green background with logomark + "Prosper Learn" wordmark + subtitle
4. **Replaced `assets/favicon.png`** (48×48 RGB PNG): Scaled-down icon for web

### Key Decisions
- Programmatically generated all assets with Python Pillow for precise sizing and reproducibility
- Logomark: open book with text lines + upward arrow = financial education + growth
- Used NimbusSans-Bold for splash wordmark
- No `app.json` changes needed (already references correct paths with #4CAF50 backgrounds)

### Verification
- All asset sizes verified correct
- Zero new TypeScript errors
- All acceptance criteria met

### Status: DONE

---

## Executor Run #12 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-012**: Create Privacy Policy Screen & Hosted URL

### Changes Made
1. **Created `src/screens/PrivacyPolicyScreen.tsx`** (new file):
   - Full privacy policy rendered as scrollable text with 9 sections
   - Covers: data collected (email, display name), purpose (auth + personalized learning), storage (Supabase cloud + AsyncStorage on-device), third-party services (Supabase only, no ad networks), data security, user rights (access, correction, deletion within 30 days), children's privacy (not directed at under-13), policy changes, contact information
   - Header with back navigation and centered title
   - Styled consistently with app design language (#F2F2F7 background, green accent, card-based)

2. **Created `app/privacy-policy.tsx`** (new file):
   - Route file that imports and renders `PrivacyPolicyScreen`

3. **Modified `app/_layout.tsx`**:
   - Added `privacy-policy` to the Stack navigator
   - Added unauthenticated access bypass: if user is on `/privacy-policy`, auth redirect is skipped
   - Screen uses `headerShown: false` since PrivacyPolicyScreen has its own header

4. **Modified `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`**:
   - Added `useRouter` import from `expo-router`
   - Added new "Legal" section below Settings with "Privacy Policy" pressable link
   - Link navigates to `/privacy-policy` via `router.push()`
   - Added `menuChevron` style for the arrow indicator

5. **Modified `src/i18n/en.json`**:
   - Added `profile.legal` ("Legal") and `profile.privacyPolicy` ("Privacy Policy")

6. **Modified `src/i18n/pt-BR.json`**:
   - Added `profile.legal` ("Legal") and `profile.privacyPolicy` ("Política de Privacidade")

### Key Decisions
- Made the privacy policy screen accessible without authentication to satisfy the acceptance criteria and allow external linking (e.g., from Play Console)
- Used the developer's actual email (danielelielgaio@gmail.com) as the contact email in the policy
- Did NOT implement the hosted URL portion of TASK-012 — this depends on TASK-016 (GitHub Pages landing page). Documented this in the task completion note.
- Created a separate "Legal" section in the Profile tab (distinct from "Settings") for clean separation and to prepare for TASK-014 (Terms of Service) which will add a second link here

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` confirms zero new TypeScript errors
- All pre-existing errors remain unchanged (infrastructure/supabase Deno functions, education component re-exports, educationalTutor)
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ `src/screens/PrivacyPolicyScreen.tsx` exists and renders a complete, readable privacy policy
  - ✅ Policy covers: data collected (email, name), purpose, storage, no ad data sharing, deletion rights, contact info
  - ✅ `app/privacy-policy.tsx` route exists and renders `PrivacyPolicyScreen`
  - ✅ Profile tab contains a "Privacy Policy" pressable link navigating to `/privacy-policy`
  - ✅ Screen is accessible without authentication
  - ⏳ Hosted URL pending TASK-016 (GitHub Pages)

### Status: DONE

---

## Planner Run #12 — 2026-03-21

### Stage Assessment
**PRE-RELEASE** — Engineering MVP is complete. Build infrastructure (eas.json, app.json compliance) is done. Three remaining blockers before Play Store submission: TASK-012 (Privacy Policy), TASK-007 (Branded Icon), and TASK-003 (Submission itself). TASK-010 (Sentry) is P2 and can follow launch.

### Key Discoveries
- **Icon still placeholder**: `assets/icon.png` is a 1024×1024 PNG in colormap mode (Mode P) with center pixel RGB (221, 221, 225) — clearly the default Expo white/gray icon. TASK-007 is genuinely not done.
- **No PrivacyPolicyScreen.tsx found**: No file matching `PrivacyPolicy*` exists anywhere in `src/` or `app/`. TASK-012 is genuinely not done.
- **eas.json confirmed**: File is valid and present with correct `development`, `preview`, and `production` profiles. TASK-011 ✅ confirmed.
- **app.json confirmed compliant**: `targetSdkVersion: 34`, `versionCode: 1`, `splash.backgroundColor: #4CAF50`. TASK-013 ✅ confirmed.
- **No Terms of Service anywhere**: The app has user account creation but no ToS. Google Play best practice (and legal prudence) requires this alongside the privacy policy.
- **No push notifications**: No `expo-notifications` in `package.json`. Streak system is built but there is no reminder mechanism — Day-2 retention is at risk post-launch.
- **No web presence**: No landing page, no GitHub Pages setup. The privacy policy has no hosted URL yet (blocked TASK-012 from being fully completeable without an external host).

### Key Decisions
- **Added TASK-014** (Terms of Service Screen, P2): Same executor run as TASK-012 — they are natural companions, share the same Profile tab settings destination, and together satisfy legal requirements. Sign-up screen should reference both.
- **Added TASK-015** (Push Notifications for Streak Reminders, P2): Day-2 retention is the most critical post-launch metric for education apps. The streak system is fully built; notifications are the missing activation layer. Should be built pre-launch or within days of launch.
- **Added TASK-016** (App Landing Page on GitHub Pages, P3): Solves three problems at once — hosts the privacy policy URL (needed for TASK-012 and Play Console), provides a web presence for credibility, enables lightweight marketing. Pure static HTML, zero infrastructure needed.

### Current Active Task Priority Order
1. TASK-012 (P1) — Privacy Policy Screen + Hosted URL (BLOCKS launch)
2. TASK-007 (P1) — Custom Branded Icon & Splash (BLOCKS screenshots & store presence)
3. TASK-003 (P1) — Play Store Submission (depends on 012, 007)
4. TASK-014 (P2) — Terms of Service Screen (companion to 012, run together)
5. TASK-015 (P2) — Push Notifications for Streak Reminders (pre/post-launch)
6. TASK-010 (P2) — Sentry Crash Reporting (immediately post-launch)
7. TASK-016 (P3) — App Landing Page (supports 012's hosted URL + growth)

### Updated Critical Path to Launch
1. TASK-016 → Set up GitHub Pages (provides stable URL for privacy policy)
2. TASK-012 → Privacy Policy Screen + add hosted URL to Play Console
3. TASK-014 → Terms of Service Screen (same sprint as 012)
4. TASK-007 → Custom Branded Icon & Splash
5. TASK-003 → Final Play Store Submission

## Executor Run #11 — 2026-03-21

### Tasks Executed
**TASK-011**: Create `eas.json` Build Configuration for Production AAB
**TASK-013**: Update `app.json` for Play Store Compliance

### Changes Made
1. **Created `eas.json`** (new file):
   - `development` profile: `developmentClient: true`, `distribution: "internal"`
   - `preview` profile: `distribution: "internal"`, `android.buildType: "apk"` for internal testing
   - `production` profile: `distribution: "store"`, `android.buildType: "app-bundle"` for Play Store AAB
   - `submit.production.android` config with service account key path and `track: "internal"`
   - `cli.version: ">= 12.0.0"`, `cli.appVersionSource: "remote"`

2. **Modified `app.json`**:
   - Added `"targetSdkVersion": 34` to `expo.android` (Google Play requirement since Aug 2024)
   - Added `"versionCode": 1` to `expo.android` (Play Console requirement)
   - Changed `expo.splash.backgroundColor` from `"#ffffff"` to `"#4CAF50"` (brand green)
   - Changed `expo.android.adaptiveIcon.backgroundColor` from `"#ffffff"` to `"#4CAF50"` (brand green)
   - `android.package` remains `com.prospersync.learn` (unchanged)

### Key Decisions
- Combined both P0 tasks in a single run since they are trivially small config-only changes with no code impact
- Set `appVersionSource: "remote"` so EAS manages version codes automatically after the initial versionCode 1
- Included a `submit` section in eas.json for future `eas submit` usage (targets `internal` track for initial testing)
- Set `cli.version >= 12.0.0` to ensure compatibility with current EAS CLI features

### Verification
- Both `eas.json` and `app.json` validated as valid JSON via `JSON.parse()`
- `npx tsc --noEmit` confirms zero new TypeScript errors (all errors are pre-existing: Deno edge functions, education component re-exports, educationalTutor)
- All TASK-011 acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ `eas.json` exists at repo root
  - ✅ `production` profile with `distribution: "store"` targeting Android
  - ✅ `preview` profile with `distribution: "internal"` and `buildType: "apk"`
  - ✅ Valid JSON (no syntax errors)
  - ✅ `app.json` `android.package` remains `com.prospersync.learn`
- All TASK-013 acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ `android` block contains `"targetSdkVersion": 34`
  - ✅ `android` block contains `"versionCode": 1`
  - ✅ `splash.backgroundColor` changed to `"#4CAF50"`
  - ✅ `android.adaptiveIcon.backgroundColor` changed to `"#4CAF50"`
  - ✅ File remains valid JSON; no existing fields removed or broken

### Status: DONE (both tasks)

## Planner Run #11 — 2026-03-21

### Stage Assessment
**PRE-RELEASE** — MVP and onboarding are fully complete. The full user journey (Auth → Onboarding → Track List → Track Detail → Lesson → XP → Achievements) is end-to-end functional. Engineering work is done. Focus shifts entirely to Play Store release infrastructure and legal compliance.

### Key Discoveries
- **TASK-006 (Onboarding) confirmed COMPLETE**: `OnboardingScreen.tsx` is a 3-page FlatList swipe experience (Welcome, Track Demo, Category Picker) with skip, AsyncStorage persistence (`onboarding_complete`), and full routing in `_layout.tsx`. Already in Completed Tasks.
- **`eas.json` is MISSING**: Critical blocker. `eas build` cannot produce a signed release AAB without it. Added as TASK-011 (P0).
- **`app.json` Play Store gaps**: Missing `targetSdkVersion: 34` (required by Google since Aug 2024), missing `versionCode: 1`, splash/adaptiveIcon backgrounds still `#ffffff` instead of `#4CAF50`. Added as TASK-013 (P0).
- **No privacy policy**: App collects email via Supabase Auth — Play Store requires a privacy policy URL. Added as TASK-012 (P1).

### Key Decisions
- Broke TASK-003 into sub-tasks: TASK-011 (eas.json), TASK-013 (app.json), TASK-012 (privacy policy). TASK-003 is now the final Play Console submission step.
- Elevated eas.json and app.json compliance to P0 — without these, no Play Store submission is possible regardless of app quality.

### Current Active Task Priority Order
1. TASK-011 (P0) — Create `eas.json`
2. TASK-013 (P0) — Update `app.json` for Play Store compliance
3. TASK-007 (P1) — Custom branded icon & splash
4. TASK-012 (P1) — Privacy policy screen + hosted URL
5. TASK-003 (P1) — Final Play Store submission (blocked by above)
6. TASK-010 (P2) — Sentry crash reporting

## Executor Run #10 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-006**: Implement User Onboarding Flow

### Changes Made
1. **Created `src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx`** (new file):
   - 3-screen horizontal-swipe onboarding using `FlatList` with `pagingEnabled`
   - **Screen 1 (Welcome)**: Hero emoji, "Welcome to Prosper Learn" title, description, and 3 feature highlight cards (lessons, XP, badges)
   - **Screen 2 (Tracks)**: Explains the track-based learning system with a visual demo card showing a sample track with progress bar, lesson count, and XP
   - **Screen 3 (Pick Topic)**: Category selector with 5 options (Basics, Budgeting, Investing, Debt, Goals) — tap to select, visual checkmark feedback
   - "Skip" button (top-right) available on all screens
   - "Next" / "Get Started" button at bottom advances pages or completes onboarding
   - Page indicator dots (active dot is wider + green)
   - On complete/skip: sets `AsyncStorage` key `onboarding_complete` to `'true'` and calls `router.replace('/')`
   - Exports `ONBOARDING_COMPLETE_KEY` constant for use in `_layout.tsx`

2. **Created `app/onboarding/index.tsx`** (new file):
   - Route file that imports and renders `OnboardingScreen`

3. **Modified `app/_layout.tsx`**:
   - Added `AsyncStorage` check for `onboarding_complete` key on mount
   - `AuthGate` now tracks `onboardingChecked` and `onboardingComplete` state
   - Routing logic updated: authenticated users who haven't completed onboarding are redirected to `/onboarding`; users who have completed it are redirected to main app
   - Added `<Stack.Screen name="onboarding">` to the navigator
   - Loading screen waits for both auth and onboarding check before rendering

4. **Modified `src/i18n/en.json`**:
   - Added `onboarding` section with 12 translation keys covering all 3 screens

5. **Modified `src/i18n/pt-BR.json`**:
   - Added Portuguese translations for all onboarding keys

### Key Decisions
- Used `FlatList` with `pagingEnabled` rather than a third-party carousel — keeps dependencies minimal and leverages native scroll behavior
- Category selection on screen 3 is optional (user can proceed without choosing) — avoids forcing a choice that might feel premature
- `onboarding_complete` defaults to `true` in state to prevent flash of onboarding screens for existing users; only set to `false` after AsyncStorage confirms no flag exists
- Placed onboarding AFTER auth (not before) — user must sign up/in first, then sees onboarding. This ensures userId is available if we later want to persist their category preference
- Exported `ONBOARDING_COMPLETE_KEY` from OnboardingScreen to ensure a single source of truth for the key string

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` confirms zero new TypeScript errors
- All pre-existing errors remain unchanged (infrastructure/supabase Deno functions, education component re-exports, educationalTutor)
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Onboarding shown only on first launch (gated by AsyncStorage `onboarding_complete`)
  - ✅ 3 screens: welcome/value prop, track system explainer, pick a category
  - ✅ User can skip onboarding via "Skip" button on any screen
  - ✅ After completing or skipping, `onboarding_complete` is set and onboarding never shows again
  - ✅ Onboarding CTA leads user to Education tab (main app) via `router.replace('/')`

### Status: DONE

---

## Executor Run #9 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-009**: Add Global React Error Boundary

### Changes Made
1. **Created `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`** (new file):
   - React class component with `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch`
   - Fallback UI: error emoji (😟), "Something went wrong" title, reassuring message, green "Try Again" button
   - "Try Again" resets `hasError` state → re-renders children (recovery without app restart)
   - Dev-only error details card showing the error message in monospace red text
   - Errors logged to console via `console.error` with component stack trace
   - Styled with the app's design language (green primary #4CAF50, card-based, 12px border radius, #F2F2F7 background)

2. **Modified `app/_layout.tsx`**:
   - Imported `ErrorBoundary` from `../src/components/ErrorBoundary`
   - Wrapped `<AuthProvider><AuthGate /></AuthProvider>` with `<ErrorBoundary>` in `RootLayout`
   - Boundary is at the outermost level so it catches errors from any component in the tree

### Key Decisions
- Placed ErrorBoundary OUTSIDE AuthProvider so even auth-related render errors are caught
- Used ScrollView in fallback UI to handle small screens or long error messages
- Dev-only error details gated behind `__DEV__` to avoid leaking stack traces in production
- Console logging uses `[ErrorBoundary]` prefix for easy filtering in dev tools
- Left a comment noting Sentry integration point for TASK-010

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` confirms zero new TypeScript errors
- All pre-existing errors remain unchanged (infrastructure/supabase Deno functions, education component re-exports, educationalTutor)
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Class component `ErrorBoundary` with `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError`
  - ✅ Wraps main app content in `app/_layout.tsx`
  - ✅ Fallback UI shown on render error (not white screen)
  - ✅ Fallback includes: error emoji, "Something went wrong" title, descriptive message, "Try Again" button
  - ✅ "Try Again" resets `hasError` state and re-renders children
  - ✅ Error details logged to console for debugging

### Status: DONE

---

## Executor Run #8 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-008**: Auto-Update Daily Learning Streak on Lesson Completion

### Changes Made
1. **Modified `app/lesson/[id].tsx`**:
   - Added imports: `format`, `isToday`, `isYesterday`, `parseISO` from `date-fns`; `Streak` type from `../../src/lib/types`
   - Added `updateDailyStreak(userId: string)` async function before the `LessonScreen` component
   - Wired `await updateDailyStreak(userId)` into `handleCompleteLesson()` after XP is saved

### Key Decisions
- Used `'educational'` as the streak type (matches `StreakTypeSchema` enum) rather than `'daily_lesson'` which the task description mentioned but doesn't exist in the type system
- Streak is created with milestones at 3, 7, 14, and 30 days — these are tracked and timestamped when reached
- When a streak is broken (missed day), `startDate` is reset to today so the streak period is accurate
- Streak update is non-blocking for the completion UX — it runs after XP is saved but failure doesn't prevent the success toast from showing (the try/catch in `handleCompleteLesson` already handles this)

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` confirms zero new TypeScript errors in `app/lesson/[id].tsx`
- All pre-existing errors remain unchanged (infrastructure/supabase Deno functions, education component re-exports, educationalTutor)
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Completing any lesson increments the `educational` streak counter for the current user
  - ✅ If already completed a lesson today, streak is NOT incremented again (idempotent via `isToday` check)
  - ✅ Consecutive-day completions grow `currentStreak` (via `isYesterday` check)
  - ✅ Missing a day resets `currentStreak` to 1 (neither today nor yesterday → reset)
  - ✅ `longestStreak` updated whenever `currentStreak` exceeds it
  - ✅ Streak is visible in `GamificationScreen` via existing `StreakList` widget (uses `gamificationService.getActiveStreaks`)
  - ✅ Uses `date-fns` for all date operations — no moment.js or custom parsing

### Status: DONE

---

## Planner Run #6 — 2026-03-21

### Stage Assessment
**MVP COMPLETE** — TASK-002 was completed by the executor (Run #7) concurrently with this planning cycle. The full user journey (Auth → Track List → Track Detail → Lesson → XP Award) is now end-to-end functional. The app is a shippable MVP. Focus shifts entirely to: production safety, retention mechanics, branding, and Play Store submission.

### Key Decisions
- **TASK-002 confirmed COMPLETE**: The executor created `TrackDetailScreen.tsx` and wired it into `app/track/[id].tsx`. The MVP core loop is done.
- **Added TASK-008** (Streak Auto-Update on Lesson Completion, P1): The streak infrastructure is fully built in `gamificationService` — `saveStreak`, `getStreakByType`, `Streak` type, `StreakList` widget. But completing a lesson in `app/lesson/[id].tsx` does NOT update the streak. This is a pure wiring task with massive retention ROI. `date-fns` (already in `package.json`) enables date comparison. Estimated: 30–45 min to implement.
- **Added TASK-009** (Global Error Boundary, P1): No React error boundary exists. Any render exception = white screen of death with no recovery. Must be fixed before real users. Simple class component at app root.
- **Added TASK-010** (Sentry Crash Reporting, P2): Zero observability post-launch. Sentry React Native auto-captures exceptions. Should be set up before or immediately after first Play Store upload. Depends on TASK-009.

### Critical Path to Launch (Updated)
1. TASK-007 → Branded icon & splash (P1, prerequisite for screenshots & store presence)
2. TASK-008 → Streak auto-update on lesson completion (P1, Day-2+ retention)
3. TASK-009 → Global error boundary (P1, production safety)
4. TASK-006 → User onboarding flow (P1, Day 1 conversion)
5. TASK-003 → Play Store submission prep (P1, final gate to real users)
6. TASK-010 → Sentry crash reporting (P2, post-launch observability)

### Notable Observations
- The MVP core loop is DONE. No more P0 engineering blockers remain.
- All existing gamification infrastructure (streaks, badges, XP, leaderboards) is built but streak update on lesson completion is missing — highest-ROI wiring task remaining.
- `app.json` still has white background (#ffffff) for icon/splash — must change to brand green (#4CAF50) in TASK-007.
- No `eas.json` exists — cannot generate signed release AAB without it (blocked by TASK-003).

## Executor Run #7 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-002**: Build Track Detail Screen & Wire into Route

### Changes Made
1. **Created `src/screens/TrackDetailScreen.tsx`** (new file):
   - Full Track Detail screen receiving `trackId` prop
   - Loads track via `educationalTrackEngine.getTrack(trackId)` and lessons via `getTrackLessons(trackId)`
   - **Track header**: title, difficulty badge (color-coded), description, stats row (lesson count, total XP, estimated hours)
   - **Progress section**: progress bar, completion count, XP earned vs total — only shown when user has started
   - **Lesson list**: ordered lesson cards with: order number (or ✓ if completed), title, description, type badge (article/quiz/video/interactive/challenge with distinct colors and emojis), duration, XP reward, in-progress dot indicator
   - **Navigation**: tapping a lesson → `router.push('/lesson/' + lesson.id)`, back arrow → `router.back()`
   - **Error state**: graceful "Track Not Found" with emoji, message, and Go Back button for invalid trackIds
   - **Pull-to-refresh**: RefreshControl to reload track data and lesson progress
   - **Lesson progress**: loads per-lesson progress via `educationalService.getLessonProgress(userId, trackId)` and renders completion state
   - **Design**: follows existing app design language (card-based, #f5f5f5 background, white cards with shadows, 12px border radius, green primary color)

2. **Rewrote `app/track/[id].tsx`**:
   - Changed import from `EducationalTrackScreen` to `TrackDetailScreen`
   - Renders `<TrackDetailScreen trackId={id || ''} />` instead of `<EducationalTrackScreen trackId={id} />`
   - Renamed default export to `TrackDetailRoute` for clarity

### Key Decisions
- Built `TrackDetailScreen` as a named export in its own file (not modifying `EducationalTrackScreen`) to keep the track list and track detail as separate, focused components
- Used `LessonCard` sub-component with order number circle (showing ✓ for completed lessons) for clear visual progress indication
- Added stats row (lessons/XP/time) in a styled card rather than inline text for visual hierarchy
- Progress bar uses green (#4CAF50) to match the app's primary action color
- Used `opacity: 0.75` on completed lesson cards to visually de-emphasize them while keeping them accessible

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` confirms zero new TypeScript errors introduced
- All pre-existing errors remain unchanged (infrastructure/supabase Deno functions, education component re-exports, educationalTutor)
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ `app/track/[id].tsx` imports and renders `TrackDetailScreen` (not `EducationalTrackScreen`)
  - ✅ Track detail displays title, description, difficulty badge, XP total, lesson list
  - ✅ Each lesson card shows title, type, duration, XP reward, and ✓ if completed
  - ✅ Tapping a lesson navigates to `/lesson/${lesson.id}`
  - ✅ Back navigation returns to track list
  - ✅ Invalid trackId shows graceful error state

### Status: DONE

### Notes
- The full MVP core loop is now end-to-end functional: Auth → Track List → Track Detail → Lesson → Complete → XP
- All P0 tasks are now complete. Remaining work is P1/P2 polish (onboarding, streaks, branding, error boundary, Play Store prep)

---

## Planner Run #5 — 2026-03-21

### Stage Assessment
**MVP (Advanced)** — Auth, navigation, and lesson rendering are all complete. The sole remaining P0 blocker before the app is end-to-end functional is the missing Track Detail Screen. Once that screen exists, a user can authenticate → browse tracks → view lessons in a track → complete a lesson and earn XP. That constitutes a shippable MVP core loop.

### Key Decisions
- **Refined TASK-002**: Updated description to precisely name the remaining gap — no Track Detail Screen exists. `app/track/[id].tsx` passes `trackId` to `EducationalTrackScreen` but that component ignores it and renders the full track list. A new `TrackDetailScreen` must be created using `educationalTrackEngine.getTrack(trackId)` and `educationalTrackEngine.getTrackLessons(trackId)`. The executor has all necessary APIs already available.
- **Added TASK-007**: Custom branded app icon & splash screen (P1). A concrete blocker for Play Store submission that has never been formally tracked. Current assets are default Expo white placeholders. TASK-003 (store prep) already depends on having real screenshots, which in turn require real assets. Made this a dependency of TASK-003.
- **TASK-003 dependency updated**: Added TASK-007 as a dependency (screenshots cannot be meaningful without real branding).
- **TASK-006 retained at P1**: Onboarding is a key retention lever; should be built immediately after TASK-002 since the core loop will be functional.

### Critical Path (in order)
1. TASK-002 → Track Detail Screen (P0, unblocks full user journey)
2. TASK-007 → Custom app icon & splash (P1, unblocks real screenshots)
3. TASK-006 → User onboarding flow (P1, Day 1 retention)
4. TASK-003 → Play Store submission (P1, final gate to real users)

### Notable Observations
- `educationalTrackEngine` already exposes `getTrack(trackId)` and `getTrackLessons(trackId)` — the Track Detail Screen can be built without any engine changes
- `educationalService` exposes progress APIs that can indicate lesson completion state for the detail screen
- The app is very close to a coherent MVP: one screen away from a complete primary user journey

---

## Executor Run #4 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-005**: Implement Lesson Screen Content Rendering

### Changes Made
1. **Modified `src/lib/ai/educationalTrack.ts`**:
   - Added `getLessonById(lessonId: string)` method to `EducationalTrackEngine` class
   - Enables direct lesson lookup without requiring trackId (uses internal lessons Map)

2. **Rewrote `app/lesson/[id].tsx`** (complete replacement — was a placeholder):
   - **Article rendering**: Displays title, description, and body text for article/interactive/challenge types
   - **Quiz rendering**: Full quiz experience with multiple-choice questions, option selection (A/B/C/D), submit button (disabled until all questions answered), score feedback (pass at 70%), per-question correct/incorrect highlighting, explanation boxes
   - **Video type**: Placeholder with video icon + body text
   - **Lesson completion flow**: "Complete Lesson" button calls `educationalService.startLesson()` on load and `educationalService.completeLesson()` on completion
   - **XP system**: Awards lesson XP + bonus for quiz_passed (50 XP) + bonus for perfect_quiz (100 XP). Saves XPEvent and updates UserXP totals via `gamificationService`
   - **Success feedback**: Animated green toast overlay with XP earned, plus post-completion state with "Back to Track" button
   - **Error handling**: Graceful error state for invalid/missing lesson IDs with back navigation
   - **Design**: Follows existing app design language (green primary, card-based, rounded 12px corners, consistent typography)

### Verification
- Zero new TypeScript errors introduced (pre-existing errors in `infrastructure/supabase`, `app/track/[id].tsx`, `src/components/education/index.ts`, `src/lib/ai/educationalTutor.ts` remain unchanged)
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ LessonScreen fetches lesson data using `educationalTrackEngine.getLessonById(id)`
  - ✅ Text-type lessons render title, description, and content body
  - ✅ Quiz-type lessons render questions with multiple-choice answers and feedback
  - ✅ "Complete Lesson" button calls `educationalService.completeLesson(userId, trackId, lessonId)`
  - ✅ XP is awarded and success animation/toast is shown
  - ✅ Invalid lesson ID shows graceful error state (not a crash)

### Status: DONE

### Notes
- The lesson screen is now fully functional but navigation TO lessons (from a track detail view) is not yet wired. Currently `app/track/[id].tsx` renders the full `EducationalTrackScreen` (track list) rather than a track detail with lesson list. This is tracked as part of TASK-002.
- TASK-002 (Wire End-to-End Lesson Experience) is now partially complete: ✅ navigation API fixed (TASK-004), ✅ lesson screen implemented (TASK-005). Remaining: wire track detail → lesson navigation.

---

## Executor Run #3 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-004**: Fix Navigation Bug in EducationalTrackScreen (expo-router vs React Navigation)

### Changes Made
1. **Modified `src/screens/EducationalTrackScreen.tsx`**:
   - Added `import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';`
   - Removed `{ navigation }: any` prop from `EducationalTrackScreen` component signature
   - Added `const router = useRouter();` inside the component
   - Changed `handleTrackPress` from `navigation.navigate('TrackDetail', { trackId: track.id })` to `router.push('/track/' + track.id)`

### Verification
- No references to `navigation` remain in the file (confirmed via grep)
- TypeScript compilation: all errors are pre-existing in `node_modules` (react-navigation types, expo-router types) — zero new errors introduced
- Route target `app/track/[id].tsx` exists and correctly renders `EducationalTrackScreen`

### Status: DONE

### Notes
- `app/track/[id].tsx` passes a `trackId` prop to `EducationalTrackScreen`, but the component doesn't use it (it renders the full track list). This is a pre-existing architectural concern outside TASK-004's scope.
- TASK-005 (Lesson Screen) is now unblocked since navigation works.

---

## Executor Run #1 — 2026-03-21

### Task Executed
**TASK-001**: Implement User Authentication Flow

### Changes Made
1. **Created `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`** — AuthContext + AuthProvider + useAuth hook wrapping Supabase Auth. Provides `session`, `user`, `loading`, `signUp`, `signIn`, `signOut`.
2. **Created `app/auth/index.tsx`** — Full auth screen with email/password sign-in and sign-up forms, input validation, error handling, loading states, and i18n support (EN + pt-BR).
3. **Created `app/auth/_layout.tsx`** — Expo Router layout for auth group.
4. **Updated `app/_layout.tsx`** — Wrapped app in `AuthProvider`, added `AuthGate` component that redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth` and authenticated users to main app. Added i18n initialization import.
5. **Updated `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`** — Now displays real user email, name (from user_metadata or email prefix), avatar initial, and live XP/level from gamificationService. Added sign-out button with confirmation dialog.
6. **Updated `src/screens/GamificationScreen.tsx`** — Replaced `'current-user-id'` with `user?.id ?? ''` from `useAuth()`.
7. **Updated `src/screens/EducationalTrackScreen.tsx`** — Replaced `'current-user-id'` with `user?.id ?? ''` from `useAuth()`.
8. **Created `src/i18n/index.ts`, `en.json`, `pt-BR.json`** — Copied from worktree and added auth + profile translation keys for both EN and pt-BR.

### Verification
- TypeScript compilation passes for all modified/created files (zero new errors)
- Pre-existing TS errors in `infrastructure/supabase` (Deno edge functions) and some education components are unrelated

### Status: DONE

---

## Run #2 — 2026-03-21

### Stage Assessment
**MVP (Advanced)** — Authentication is fully complete and wired. The education track list renders real data. However, the core content flow is broken by a navigation API mismatch and a placeholder lesson screen. The app cannot deliver its core value (financial education) until TASK-004 and TASK-005 are resolved.

### Key Decisions
- Marked **TASK-001 as COMPLETE** — auth hook, auth screen, auth routing guard, and real userId propagation are all implemented
- Promoted **TASK-004** (navigation bug fix) as a separate P0 — `navigation.navigate()` in EducationalTrackScreen will throw a TypeError at runtime since this is an expo-router app; this is the most urgent single fix
- Added **TASK-005** (lesson screen implementation) as P0 — the placeholder LessonScreen makes the core product nonfunctional even after the navigation fix
- Added **TASK-006** (onboarding flow) as P1 — first-time user experience is critical for retention; should be addressed immediately after the core flow is working
- Retained **TASK-003** (Play Store prep) at P1 — no blocking changes, but still requires `eas.json`, `targetSdkVersion`, privacy policy, and store listing assets

### Notable Observations
- `EducationalTrackScreen` is well-built (category filter, in-progress/completed sections, real data) but the `handleTrackPress` navigation call is the React Navigation API, not expo-router — a one-line fix unlocks the entire track flow
- Assets appear to be default Expo placeholders (white background) — custom branding will be required for Play Store submission
- No `eas.json` exists yet — EAS Build setup is a prerequisite for generating a release APK/AAB

### Completed This Cycle
- TASK-001: User Authentication Flow — fully complete

---

## Run #1 — 2026-03-21

### Stage Assessment
**MVP** — The app has a solid foundation (Supabase, gamification service, AI educational track engine with 30+ lessons, offline-first progress tracking, i18n for EN + pt-BR) but the UI is not connected to the backend. Core user flows are broken or stubbed.

### Key Decisions
- Prioritized **authentication first** (TASK-001) because `userId` being hardcoded blocks all personalization; nothing can be tested end-to-end without it
- Prioritized **lesson experience wiring** (TASK-002) as P0 because without it, the app's core value proposition (financial education) is completely inaccessible
- Prioritized **Play Store prep** (TASK-003) as P1 because it has a long tail (privacy policy, screenshots, build config) and should be started early even before the app is fully polished

### Notable Architecture Observations
- The codebase is well-structured; services and AI modules exist but are not consumed by UI screens
- `EducationScreen.tsx` is the biggest gap — it uses MOCK_TRACKS and a no-op `handleTrackPress`
- `LessonScreen` (`app/lesson/[id].tsx`) is a placeholder with zero content rendering logic
- `GamificationScreen` is the most complete screen — it calls real service methods but uses hardcoded `userId`
- i18n is wired (`react-i18next`) with translations for EN and pt-BR — suggesting Brazil may be the primary market
- Supabase edge functions exist for gamification: `upgrade-badge`, `check-badge-upgrades`, `redeem-reward`

### Deferred to Future Runs
- Onboarding flow (user education on first launch)
- Push notifications for streak reminders
- Analytics / crash reporting (Sentry or similar)
- App icon validation (ensure not default Expo assets)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions + EAS Build)
- Monetization model (not yet determined)
- Landing page / web presence
- Content rating questionnaire for Play Store
